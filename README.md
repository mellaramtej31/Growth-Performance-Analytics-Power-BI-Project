# Growth Performance & Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## üìä About The Project

This project presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence dashboard built using Power BI to analyze and visualize sales performance for a retail business. The dashboard provides a holistic view of key business metrics across various dimensions and includes a predictive forecasting model to estimate future sales.

The solution is divided into two main sections:
1.  **Dashboard:** An interactive overview of historical performance, focusing on sales, profit, and customer behavior.
2.  **Forecasting:** A time-series analysis graph that projects sales for the next 15 days.

This tool is designed for business managers, sales teams, and data analysts to derive actionable insights, monitor growth, and make data-driven decisions.

    * **Total Quantity:** 22.32K units
    * **Total Profit:** $0.18M
    * **Average Delivery Days:** 3.93 days
* **Regional & Segment Performance:** Donut charts break down sales by Region, Customer Segment, and Payment Mode, quickly identifying top-performing areas.

* **Product & Logistics Insights:** Bar charts provide detailed breakdowns of sales by `Category`, `Sub-Category`, and `Ship Mode`.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** An interactive map visualizes `Sales and Profit by State`, allowing for geographic exploration of performance hotspots.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Users can dynamically filter the entire dashboard by `Region` (Central, East, South, West) to drill down into specific areas.

### Forecasting Page

This page focuses on predictive analytics:
